# IsTreeBST
C# program to find whether a given binary tree is BST 

Logic/Algorithm
----------------

Since Inorder Traversal of BST prints the nodes' values in ascending order, use it and compare the value of current node with the previous
node

If at any point previous node is greater than current node, the Binary Tree cannot be Binary Search Tree(BST)
